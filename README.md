# Nav Onboarding

Welcome to Snowbots! This repo is where you'll be working on a navigation onboarding challenge - to make our robot Olaf avoid obstacles in the real world! The goal of this is to become comfortable working with C++ and ROS, and also be used to our development processes! This challenge will look a little intimidating at first, as we've been intentionally vague in several places, but this is so we can get you to **use the power of google** or to **ask us (that's  what we're here for!)** for problem solving.

### The Robot
Our robot for IARRC, Olaf is a modified RC car that you'll interface with via USB

## The Problem
When you're assigned a project, it will be in the form of a Github Issue, so it's important that you can read and interpret them, and also ask for clarification if needed. You can read the issue for the this onboarding under the `Issues` page on this repository.

## The Learning Goals
Just when you thought this wasn't like school.... this onboarding aims to teach you the following things:
- interpreting requirements and clarifying potentially vague github issues
- C++ skillz
- general ROS knowledge
- experience with basic algorithm development

## The First Steps
1. Fork this repository
1. Clone your fork. 
1. Run `catkin_make` to ensure that everything compiles
1. Open a branch on your fork for your solution (call it whatever you want)
1. Copy `sample_package` to `obstacle_avoidance` 
1. Update all the files `obstacle_avoidance` as appropriate (you'll have to read through them all and update them if needed. If you're not sure what a file is for, feel free to ask us).
1. Develop a solution based on the github issue mentioned above (**make sure to write some gTests and at least 1 ROSTest for your solution**).
1. Push your solution to this repository using the standard fork and pull request workfow.
