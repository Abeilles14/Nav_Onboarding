# Olaf Onboarding
ðŸ”¨ **WIP** ðŸ”¨: This is the first time we're trying out this onboarding challenge, so there may be some _minor_ roadblocks along the way

Welcome to Snowbots! This repo is where you'll be working on a onboarding challenge, making our robot Olaf (pictured below), avoid obstacles in the real world! The goal of this is that by the end, you'll be more comfortable working with C++ and ROS, and also be used to our development processes! This challenge will look a little intimidating at first, as we've been intentionally vague in several places, but just **google it or ask us** (that's what we're here for!), and you'll get it figured out.

### Olaf
Our robot for IARRC, Olaf is a modified RC car that you'll interface with via USB

## The Issue 
When you're assigned a project, it will be in the form of a Github Issue, so it's important that you can read and interpret them, and also ask for clarification if needed. You can read the issue for the this onboarding under the `Issues` page on this repository.

## Learning Goals 
Just when you thought this wasn't like school.... this onboarding aims to teach you the following things:
- interpreting requirements and clarifying potentially vague github issues
- C++ skillz
- general ROS knowledge
- experience with basic algorithm development

## TODO
1. Fork this repository
1. Clone your fork. 
1. Run `catkin_make` to ensure that everything compiles
1. Open a branch on your fork for your solution (call it whatever you want)
1. Copy `sample_package` to `your_name_here` (replace with your name...) 
1. Update all the files `your_name_here` as appropriate (you'll have to read through them all and update them if needed. If you're not sure what a file is for, feel free to google it or ask us).
1. Develop a solution based on the github issue mentioned above (**make sure to write some gTest's and at least one ROSTest along the way**)
1. Open a pull request to this repositry with your solution
